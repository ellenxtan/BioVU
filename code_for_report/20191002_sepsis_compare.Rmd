# Sepsis 3

We got new data (bolded below) to calculate SOFA score compared to last time.  
  
* **Respiration SOFA score (PaO2/FiO2 and initiation of mechanical ventilation)**
* Coagulation SOFA score (platelets)
* Liver SOFA score (bilirubin)
* Central nervous system SOFA score (RASS score) 
* Cardiovascular SOFA score (pressors)  
* **Renal SOFA score (creatinine)**

## Respiration SOFA score.
For PaO2/FiO2, the distribution of raw ratio and FiO2 are both bimodal. FiO2 has two distinct ranges: 0-1 and 1-100 depends on whether the faction was converted to percentage.  The latter range were converted to 0-1 scale and PaO2/FiO2 ratio was recalculated using PaO2 and FiO2 assessed at exaclty the same time.  
For PaO2 out of range values *<30* and *>800*, they were replaced with the corresponding lower/upper limit.

```{r}

#> Ratio data ---------------------------------------------------
file_names <- list.files("../../Mito Delirium BioVU Data/Lab values/PO2_FI02_ratio",
                         pattern = ".xlsx$",
                         full.names = T)
ratio_raw <- NULL
for (file in file_names) {
  ratio_raw <- ratio_raw %>% 
    bind_rows(read_excel(file))
}
names(ratio_raw) <- str_to_lower(names(ratio_raw))
ratio_raw %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = `po2/fi (mmhg)`)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(title = 'Distribution of raw ratio')# two peaks

#> FIO2 data ------------------------------------
file_names <- list.files("../../Mito Delirium BioVU Data/Lab values/FIO2",
                         pattern = ".xlsx$",
                         full.names = T)
fio2_raw <- NULL
for (file in file_names) {
  fio2_raw <- fio2_raw %>% 
    bind_rows(read_excel(file))
}
names(fio2_raw) <- str_to_lower(names(fio2_raw))
fio2_raw %<>% distinct() 
fio2_raw %>% 
  filter(fio2 <= 100) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fio2)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(title = 'Distribution of FiO2')
```

**Quesion:**

* Is it possible to have FiO2 below 10%? They consist about 1% of all FiO2 values, which will make the ratio really large thus low SOFA score.
* What SOFA score should ratio < 200 but no ventilation patients get?  Now they were assigned 2.
* What SOFA score should ventilation but no ratio data paitents get (3,818 encounters)?  Now they were assinged missing.
* *Note that our current ventilation data is initiation of ventilation*.


PaO2/FiO2 and Ventilation | SOFA score
-----------|-----------
ratio $\ge$ 400 | 0  
300 $\le$ ratio < 400 | 1
200 $\le$ ratio < 300 or **ratio < 200 and no ventilation** | 2
100 $\le$ ratio < 200 and ventilation | 3
ratio < 100 and ventilation | 4

## Creatinine non-numerical lab values
Out of range values for creatinine were converted as following.
```{r}
#> Renal: Creatinine ----------------------------
file_names <- list.files("../../Mito Delirium BioVU Data/Lab values/Creatinine",
                         full.names = T)

#>> out of range value ------------------------
creatinine_oor <- NULL
for (file in file_names) {
  creatinine_oor <- creatinine_oor %>% 
    bind_rows(read_excel(file, sheet = 2))
}
creatinine_raw <- creatinine_oor %>% 
  rename(oor_value = `Creat mg/dL`) %>% 
  mutate(`Creat mg/dL` = case_when(
    str_detect(oor_value, ",") ~ as.numeric(str_replace(oor_value, ",", ".")),
    str_detect(oor_value, "-") ~ str_extract_all(oor_value, "[[:digit:]]*\\.*[[:digit:]]+") %>% sapply(function(x) mean(as.numeric(x))),
    T ~ as.numeric(str_extract(oor_value, "[[:digit:]]*\\.*[[:digit:]]+"))
  )) 
creatinine_raw %>% 
  distinct(oor_value, `Creat mg/dL`)
```

## Distribution of SOFA score
```{r}
summary(sepsis3$sofa) 
ggplot(sepsis3) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = sofa), binwidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of SOFA score") 
```

## Missing Data

Cardio and Respiration system had the most missing data.  About 20% of respiration missing data is due to missing PaO2/FiO2.  For cardio system, We only had partial data.
```{r}
sepsis3 %>% 
  select(sofa_respiration, sofa_coagulation, sofa_liver, sofa_cardio, sofa_cns, sofa_renal) %>% 
  sapply(function(x) percent(sum(is.na(x))/length(x))) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Percent of missing data for each system", col.names = "% missing", full_width = F) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "condensed", full_width = F)
sepsis3 %>% 
  count(data_type) %>% 
  mutate(pct = percent(n/nrow(sepsis3), accuracy = 0.01)) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Data composition of all suspected infections") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "condensed", full_width = F)
```

Although there is a lot missing, Out of the `r comma(nrow(sepsis3))` suspected infections,`r paste0(comma(sum(sepsis3$sofa >= 2, na.rm = T)), " (", percent(sum(sepsis3$sofa >= 2, na.rm = T)/nrow(sepsis3)), ")")` of SOFA scores are already $\ge 2$ calculated using available data, that is `r percent(sum(sepsis3$sofa >= 2, na.rm = T)/nrow(cam_visits))` of `r comma(nrow(cam_visits))` ICU encounters had sepsis.


```{r}
sepsis3 %>% 
  filter(sofa < 2) %>% 
  count(data_type) %>% 
  mutate(pct = percent(n/sum(sepsis3$sofa < 2, na.rm = T), accuracy = 0.1)) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Data composition for SOFA < 2") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "condensed", full_width = F)
```

# Rhee's presume infection definition
## Algorithm

* Find blood culture (BC) days within $\pm1$ day within hospital admission date
* Identify new antibiotic (not given in the prior 2 calendar days) days in $\pm2$ day window period of BC day. Antibiotics were considered the same if drug names were the same regarldess of drug route except vancomycin, for which switching from IO/IV to PO or vise versa were considered new antibotic.
* Examine 4 consecutive days after the new antibiotic days and keep only antibiotics initiated in current sequence.  Then Filter the antibiotics sequence using following criteria:
    * At least 4 calendar days (including the new antibiotic day itself)
    * At least 3 days of antibiotics admnistratoin.
    * The gap between admnistration of antibiotics is not longer than 1 day.
    * In the sequence, there must be at least one new IV/IM antibiotic within the $\pm2$ day window period of BC day.
* After applying the above criteria, only those antibiotic sequence with gaps need to be double checked for QAD.
    * If in the sequence, the day after any of the 1 day gap was new antibiotics only, i.e., not continuation of the same drug before the gap, the sequence was removed.
* Check those patients who died 4 days within the new antibiotic days (Not Done yet). **Is the new IV/IM antibiotic still required in this case?**

In total, there were `r comma(rhee_infection %>% distinct(grid, adm_id) %>% nrow())` CAM-ICU encounters with presumed serious infection under Rhee's sepsis definition.  And all of these were also identified as suspected infection under Sepsis-3 definition.
```{r}
sepsis_comp <- cam_visits %>% 
  select(grid, adm_id) %>% 
  left_join(select(sepsis3, grid, adm_id, sofa, sepsis3)) %>% 
  left_join(rhee_infection %>% 
              distinct(grid, adm_id) %>% 
              mutate(rhee = 1)) %>%
  mutate(sepsis3 = if_else(is.na(sepsis3), 0, 1),
         rhee = if_else(is.na(rhee), 0, 1))
xtabs(~ sepsis3 + rhee, data = sepsis_comp, addNA = T) 
```

For the `r comma(rhee_infection %>% distinct(grid, adm_id) %>% nrow())` CAM-ICU encounters with infection under both definition, `r sepsis_comp %>% filter(rhee == 1, sofa < 2) %>% nrow()` had sofa score < 2, potentially they could be identified as sepsis under Rhee's sepsis definition.

# Other Problems
## Lab dates falling after discharge date
`r percent(cam_visits %>% filter(hosp_days<=3) %>% nrow()/nrow(cam_visits))` of `r comma(nrow(cam_visits))` CAM-ICU encounters had 3 or fewer hospital days.  
I made sure the infection onset day (for Rhee definition it's BC date and first QAD) is within hospital stay, but did not limit lab values or subsequent QADs.  
**Do we need to limit everything within the hospital stay?**

## DOB discrepancy
When comparing the DOBs in the new demographic files and in our old *Samuels_Delirium_STATIC_20180718.csv* file, I found some discrepancies.  Some of the DOBs are more than a year apart (see below).  Luckily these are not changed GRIDs, so we donâ€™t really need to use them now, but this makes me wonder whether there are two different sets of shifted dates for some GRIDs even though the GRIDs were never changed.
```{r}
#. Get DOB for all messed-up ID --------------------------
static_raw <- read_csv("../../Mito Delirium BioVU Data/Data/Samuels_Delirium_STATIC_20180718.csv") %>% 
  mutate(DOB = mdy(DOB))  
names(static_raw) <- str_to_lower(names(static_raw))  
  
demo_file <- list.files(path = "../../Mito Delirium BioVU Data/Demographics/", 
                        pattern = "_demo.txt$", full.names = T)
demo_raw <- NULL
for (file in demo_file){
  demo_raw %<>% 
    bind_rows(read_tsv(file, na = c("", "NA", "null"),
                       col_types = "cccnnnnnnnccc"))
}
names(demo_raw) <- str_to_lower(names(demo_raw))
demo_raw %<>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  mutate(dob = ymd(dob))

demo_raw %>% 
  select(grid, dob) %>% 
  inner_join(
    static_raw %>% 
      select(grid, dob),
    by = "grid") %>% 
  filter(dob.x != dob.y) %>% 
  mutate(diff = dob.x - dob.y) %>% 
  filter(abs(diff) > 10)
```




# Next steps

* To identify acute organ dysfunction, baseline lab values are defined as the best values during hospitalization since all our infections are "present on admission" (BC day occuring on hospital day 1 or 2) based on Rhee's definition.
* **How to calculate mean arterial pressure (MAP)?** I found this fomula online $\frac{SBP + 2DBP}{3}$, is it correct?
