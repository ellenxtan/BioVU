* Produced by [sepsis3.R](https://github.com/meerkatR/BioVU/blob/master/sepsis3.R)
* Encounter level data
* For each encounter with suspected infection, to determine whether meeting Sepsis-3's organ dysfunction crietria, the worst daily SOFA score in the time window from 2 day before to 1 day after the onset date of infection was used. 
  * All the lab values/SOFA scores in this file are pertain to that worst daily SOFA score
* Fields
  * __grid__
  * __adm_id__ - admission/encounter ID
  * __adm_date, dc_date__ - date of admission/discharge
  * __onset_date__ - onset date of suspected infection, as defined by Sepsis-3 paper, was whichever earlier of antibiotics administration date and body fuild culture date
  * __onset_day__ - # of days from admission date to onset date.
    * calculation: onset_date - adm_date + 1
  * __lab_date__ - date of worst daily SOFA score
  * __bilirubin, creatinine, platelet, rass__ - worst lab values of the day
  * __map, pf_ratio, sf_ratio__ - worst calculated MAP, PaO2/FiO2, SpO2/FiO2 values of the day
  * __pressor__ - name of the worst vasopressor taken on this day.
    * Worse order same as alphabetical order for the purpose of identifying sepsis: NOREPINEPHRINE > EPINEPHRINE > DOPAMINE > DOBUTAMINE
  * __vent__ - 1 if mechnical ventional was used on this day
  * __sofa_liver, sova_renal, sofa_coagulation, sofa_cns, sofa_cardio, sofa_respiration__ - SOFA score for 6 organ systems.
  * __sofa__ - sum of non-missing SOFA scores of 6 organ systems.
  * __data_type__ - SOFA score missing status
    * Complete data - all SOFA scores for 6 organ systems are available for that day
    * All missing - all SOFA scores for 6 organ systems are missing for that day
    * Missing > 1 system - SOFA scores of more than 1 organ system is missing.
    * No Cardio/CNS/Coagulation/Liver/Renal/Respiration SOFA - Only SOFA score of 1 organ system is missing.
  * __sepsis3__ - 1 if sofa >= 2.
